%
%  Author:  Kyle R. Wodzicki  
%  Version: 0.20.01
%  Updated: 16 Jun. 2020
%    Better matches the Spring 2020 OGAPS template
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The tamu_thesis class has the following options:
%   11pt or 12pt - This sets the size of the 
%      text for the document. Use 12pt unless
%      you have approval from OGAPS to use
%      11pt.
%   thesis - Add this option to set document type to Thesis.
%             Default is Dissertation
%   phd    - Add this option to set degree to DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY.
%             Defuault is MASTER OF SCIENCE
%   onehalfspacing - Changes spacing to 1.5
%      spacing. The default is to use double
%      spacing. Do NOT use this option unless
%      you have approval from OGPAS.
%   arial - Changes the font of the document to
%      Arial. The default font is Times New Roman.
%   binding - Changes the left margin to be 1.4
%      inches for binding purposes (recommended
%      in the thesis manual). The default is to
%      use 1 inch margins on all sides.
%   chapref - Will generate a references section
%      for each chapter of the document. The
%      default is to have  References chapter
%      after the main chapters of the document.
%   natbib - Will load the natbib package that is
%      required for some bibliography styles. If
%      you don't know what natbib is, you probably
%      don't need it.
%   draft - Enables draft mode. This will speed up
%     compiling of document by disabling hyper-
%     references and inserting wire frames where
%     images/figures should be.
%   acroall - Enables display of all nomenclature
%     (acronyms) defined in the nomenclature.tex 
%      file. Default is to display only those 
%      acronyms that have been used in an \ac{}
%      command.
%   acrohover - Enable full acronym definition 
%      pop-ups when hovering over an acronym in the 
%      text. Default is to NOT show full definition
%      when hovering. May not work in Preview on Mac.

%%%  Additional Customization by Ronnie   %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Following packages have been added to modify the forked version 0.20.01 that was last updated on 16 Jun 2020
%%% The modification is aimed to:
%%% (1) Make the reference lists only appear at the end of each manuscript chapter (the "chapref" does not work well as it printed the reference sections at the end of every section, including Abstract, Dedication, Acknowledgements, etc.
%%% (2) Add packages to rotate certain pages into landscape layout
%%% (3) Add "natbib" as a preample-- did not use the provided option from Version 0.20.1 as it does not seem to work properly for some reasons
%%% Last updated: 06/14/2023
